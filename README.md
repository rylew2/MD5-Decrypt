# MD5-Decrypt

I. What

This program was given as part of a job applciation. It involved first making an Amazon Web Services POST call to get an MD5 encrypted email address. This program takes that MD5 encrypted string and an MD5 of my email address and  recursively decrypt them two characters at a time to find the final email address.

The end goal was to send my resume to the resulting email address.

II. ToDo:
-This is very inefficient with nested for loops and I've been meaning to come back and recode this.
